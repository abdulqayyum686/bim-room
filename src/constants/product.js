    description: "<p>Objects in the Bimroom Collection are high quality generic BIM objects intended to be used in conceptual design, or as placeholders in early stages of a design project when no suppliers have yet been chosen.</p>\n<p>The parametric dimensions and behavior of Bimroom Collection objects makes them adaptable for the demands of most architectural design projects. The first priority is for them to be user-friendly, with predictable parametrics and adequate levels of detail to match the requirements of the project and to maintain a reasonable file size.</p>\n<p>Bimroom Collection items are schedulable and contain appropriate graphical representations for all kinds of drawings and documentation. Their most detailed 3D representations include geometry and materials that are ready for high quality still renders, animations or real-time walkthroughs to bring the project to life in a quick and easy way.</p>\n",
